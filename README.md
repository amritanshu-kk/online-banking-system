# Online-Banking-System
Online banking system using Java, JDBC, Java Mail API etc.

## Project Description:
Online Bank Management System is very simple and entry level project developed in java using jdbc technology. I have used database to store all the details of customer account in a table.

I have implemented most of the feature of online banking in it. User can login, do withdrawal, Request a Deposit amount, Transfer amount from one account to another account, check his/her current balance, and view reports of all the transaction.

## Application:
The Online Banking System suite provides a global accounting foundation that provides the all private banks with electronic banking facilities. It allows client of private banks to carry out their day to day banking transactions.
